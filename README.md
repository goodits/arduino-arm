You'll need the arm, an arduino and the code to give it a whirl. Really recommend the kit as a quick way to get in to using motors and levers. Don't expect to pick up much more than a postit note though!

After an initial build out I did some major refactoring to make it quicker to maintain. It's added some weight to the code itself though so might need to be careful going forward. 

New to Arduino so don't be a stranger if you see a better way to do things.
